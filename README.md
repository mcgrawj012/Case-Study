#### Overview
J.P Morgan Chase is one of the biggest banks in the world. J.P Morgan prides itself on being one of the most innovative banks. CEO Jamie Dimon noticed the popularity of cryptocurrency. Dimon himself is not a fan of cryptocurrency, but he understands the company needs to move forward with its blockchain projects. J.P Morgan Chase has partnered with ConsenSys to help build the JPM coin platform. JPM coin is not a cryptocurrency but a stable coin. The JPM coin is for only J.P Morgan Chase customers. The coin will make cross-border payments easier for J.P Morgan Chase customers. 


#### Business Activities
J.P Morgan Chase has clients all around the world. One obstacle is transferring money cross-borders. These transfers take time and have a lot of fees added on. Now J.P Morgan Chase is introducing their stable coin called the JPM coin. This coin will be used for those cross-border transactions between Chase customers. The coin is only for their big business clientele who have transactions all over the world. The JPM coin has a value equal to $1.00 U.S dollar. The companies can deposit any amount of money and have it converted to the JPM coin. This will help solve the obstacle of trading cross-borders. These transactions now will happen instantly instead of days. The customers who receive the coins can then cash out the coins for U.S dollars. J.P Morgan Chase created their platform Quorum to handle these transactions. One problem Chase was having with their platform was privacy. A big bank is not the right place to maintain a large open-source software project. In 2020 ConeSys acquired J.P Morgan Chase’s Quorum platform. In return, Chase made an undisclosed investment into the company. Now ConeSys will be supporting Chase with its blockchain projects. Now having their JPM coin working on the ConeSys Quorum platform, will help other companies be able to use this technology. J.P Morgan Chase now has a new blockchain unit established called Onyx. Onyx is a shared software that will be used by many banks. J.P Morgan Chase program called Liink network has 400 banks in the network. There are about 11,000 banks worldwide. Onyx is trying to redefine how banks are doing payments with blockchain. The Onyx project will be eliminating fees and helping with the speed of the transactions. There will be no more payment breaks between transactions. J.P Morgan Chase is also looking into the future and has done blockchain transactions from outer space on their ConeSys Quorum platform. 
J.P Morgan Chase is one of the most innovative companies in the world. CEO Jamie Dimon loves blockchain technology. J.P Morgan Chase is the first bank to come out with its own coin for making cross-border transactions easier for customers. Chase was entering new territory when they decide to make its own blockchain platform. They made a wise investment when they were bought out by ConeSys which will be integrating J.P Morgan's blockchain platform on the Etherum platform.  Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionalities. Chase is the first major bank to use this platform and give this technology legitimacy in the banking world. Over the past 5 years, blockchain has become a major focus for many banks. Blockchain innovations include supply chain optimization, smart contracts, and decentralized financial transactions. J.P Morgan Chase's competitors are Libra, Ton, Morgan Stanley, Citi, Goldman Sachs, etc. Many companies are introducing more innovations for blockchain for the future.
#### Landscape
JPM coin has been introduced and is really impacting the company and the future of blockchain. It has a lot of positive feedback. The JPM coin is making it very easy for customers to transfer money cross-border. They are eliminating the hassle and the fees that go along with sending money across the world. J.P Morgan has put out a report that shows the use of this technology will help drive revenue and growth for the industry. Due to the pandemic going on, the use for digitalization is at a high. With companies not being able to meet a lot of money is being moved through digital platforms. The JPM coin is a platform that is making it easier for their customers to move money all around the world without fees. J.P Morgan is the leader in blockchain right now. They have been working on a lot of innovative ways to make blockchain transactions even better in the future and are leading the way.
#### Recommandations
I have no suggestions for Chase right now. They have really thought of everything to make this the future. They started with a very basic setup with having the coin only in American value. They have many plans for the future if this heads in the right direction. They are trying to create a link between all banks to adopt this technology by making an open platform for all to follow. They have been very innovative in trying to lead the future of blockchain.
